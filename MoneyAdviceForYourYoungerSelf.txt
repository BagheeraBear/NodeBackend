Start saving from early on; at least a part of your pocket money; and later the money that you earn in side jobs, to be invest into some of your dreams.

Resist the temptation (as a kid) to buy candy or video games — at least to a degree — and later spend money on clothes or partying ... with people who you mostly don’t like, going to clubs (which you mostly hate) and drinking (which you don’t really like either).

But then again I’ll also say that everything has been necessary to become who I am now.

I couldn’t have said to my younger self: “Hey buddy, try to already connect more with your creative side. Start with the Individuation process now. Here’s a couple of books and people you should study.”

Three buckets off assets - Saving, investments, spending. Divide your income into these three buckets based on where you are in your life. Savings - until you have 1-year of emergency funds to cover your living expenses. Investing - 401(k) until maxed yearly, ETFs, Index Funds, REITs and Dividends. Spending - enough to cover your bills and entertainment. Automate as much as possible and as you build your investment portfolio, re-invest the dividends back into your investment accounts. I started doing this late, and it is making a huge impact. If I could have done this 20 years ago, I could retire right now… visa mer

3. Get a trade before a degree (if at all a degree)
4. Put 10% of your income from day one into a superannuation fund
5. Live small and simply. There is power in controlling your inner consumer… visa mer

Tristan W. These are the videos I’m now seeing from Ramit (might help your research). He did a video on Love & Money with Matthew Hussey last week, then posted his separate  version here too.

Buy a CPO car with a warranty, not a brand new car (aka deprecating asset). Buy assets that pay you back. Take more risk.
